## Overview

The application is a converstional model with capabilities of text generation, speech recognition, speech synthesis, natural language understanding, context awareness, and avatar representation/demonstration with lip sync and gestures. The app uses state-of-the-art AI models, particularly transformers and stable diffusion model. 

A user can interact with the model either by text input or voice, the model processes the user message, understand it and generate a contextually relevant response with avatar representation, with minimal latency
